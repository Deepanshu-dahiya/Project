Overview:This is a spiritual foundation the offers multiple programs to its devotees for self-exploration and transformation. One of the programs that they offer is for inner well being derived from the science of Yoga. In the course of COVID 19 pandemic, the organization has come up with an online program for the same, for the psychological well being of people. 
Since the program is online, and the users need to register, login, watch the videos and practice, they’re facing a lot of problems and hence, there has been a sudden increase in the customer support calls.
We’ve shared a sample text data of 110 emails from the users, complaining about different issues that they face.


Expectations :
•	Using the sample data, build an effective categorization that may help the support team analyze the type of cases they receive and the frequency of such cases
•	Determine the most commonly recurring problems
•	If possible, build a solution for automating some of the frequently occurring problems
